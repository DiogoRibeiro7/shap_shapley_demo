## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. ‚úÖ Update your branch with latest upstream changes
2. ‚úÖ Run all tests and ensure they pass
3. ‚úÖ Run linters and fix any issues
4. ‚úÖ Add tests for new functionality
5. ‚úÖ Update documentation as needed
6. ‚úÖ Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes

### PR Guidelines

1. **Branch naming**:
   - `feature/description` for new features
   - `fix/description` for bug fixes
   - `docs/description` for documentation
   - `refactor/description` for refactoring
   - `test/description` for test additions

2. **Commit messages**:
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
   - Limit first line to 72 characters
   - Reference issues and PRs liberally

   Example:
   ```
   Add caching mechanism for SHAP values

   - Implement TTL-based cache with configurable expiration
   - Add cache eviction logic for expired entries
   - Include comprehensive tests for cache behavior

   Closes #123
   ```

3. **PR description**:
   - Use the PR template
   - Explain what changes you made and why
   - Link related issues
   - Add screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
   - List breaking changes (if any)

4. **PR size**:
   - Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
   - Split large changes into multiple PRs
   - Aim for < 400 lines changed per PR

### Review Process

1. At least one maintainer must approve the PR
2. All CI checks must pass
3. Coverage should not decrease (maintain ‚â•80%)
4. All conversations must be resolved
5. Maintainer will merge when ready

### After Merge

- Delete your branch (both locally and on GitHub)
- Pull latest changes from upstream
- Celebrate! üéâ

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Quotes**: Double quotes for strings
- **Imports**: Sorted with `isort`

### Type Hints

- All functions must have type hints
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references
- Prefer built-in types over `typing` module when possible (Python 3.10+)

Example:
```python
def compute_shap_values(
    model: Any,
    X_train: pd.DataFrame,
    X_test: pd.DataFrame,
    background_size: int = 100,
) -> shap.Explanation:
    """Compute SHAP values using TreeExplainer."""
    ...
```

### Docstrings

We use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.

    Longer description if needed. Explain what the function does,
    any important details, edge cases, etc.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1.
        param2: Description of param2.

    Returns:
        Description of return value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When validation fails.
        TypeError: When wrong type is provided.

    Example:
        >>> result = function_name(42, "test")
        >>> print(result)
        True
    """
    ...
```

### Code Organization

**Module structure:**
```python
"""Module docstring."""

# Standard library imports
import os
import sys

# Third-party imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Local imports
from .utils.common import helper_function

# Constants
DEFAULT_VALUE = 42

# Public API
__all__ = [
    "public_function",
    "PublicClass",
]

# Implementation
...
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions/methods**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private**: Prefix with `_`
- **Very private**: Prefix with `__`

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- All new code must have tests
- Maintain or increase coverage (target: ‚â•80%)
- Tests should be fast (< 1s per test)
- Use descriptive test names

### Test Structure

```python
class TestFeatureName:
    """Test suite for feature X."""

    def test_function_behavior_expected_result(self, fixture):
        """Test that function does X when given Y."""
        # Arrange
        input_data = ...
        expected = ...

        # Act
        result = function(input_data)

        # Assert
        assert result == expected
```

### Test Categories

Use pytest markers:

```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_expensive_operation():
    """Test that takes > 1s."""
    ...

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_full_workflow():
    """Integration test."""
    ...
```

### Fixtures

- Use fixtures for common test data
- Keep fixtures in `conftest.py`
- Document fixtures with docstrings

## Documentation

### Documentation Types

1. **Code documentation**: Docstrings in code
2. **API documentation**: Generated from docstrings
3. **User guide**: README.md and tutorials
4. **Developer guide**: This file (CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Generate API docs (if using Sphinx)
cd docs
make html
```

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams where helpful
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code
